Rhyme work plan

General: Update web site (no specific changes)

Steadily: Keep working on the dictionary (adjectives for Elise, verbs for David)

Ignore heterosyllabic and other rhyme with unequal segment counts for now

1) Within stanza:
* Find non-rhyming lines
Create additional bitstring for just stressed vowel
Build table of all rhyming and non-rhyming bitstrings
Assign non-rhyming lines according to following ranked priorities
(domain provisionally 6; test others later)
a) Closest match; weight stressed vowel more heavily than anything
b) Closest proximity? (probably won't be needed)
Some lines may not rhyme with anything, e.g., ABCB

2) Compare stanzas to identify rhyme scheme
Is there a regular pattern across stanzas? If so, adjust for it
Check for false matches in, e.g., ABCB; identify by large edit distance and pattern

3) After rhyme schemes have been identified for seed corpus
Load poems into eXist
Create API to find existing rhymes (exact and inexact)
Build lookup into algorithm for subsequent content

4) Analysis
Common ~ uncommon rhyme by poet
Feature analysis by poet
